### Routine

Begin ~~about halfway~~ just a little ways down a long side, with leader facing DC.
Before starting, sway and prep step with the left foot on count 4.
Expect one competition round to involve running through this routine twice through.

##### Long Side
1. [Feather Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EbBv9b7N8) (SQQ)
	- Ends with leader facing DC, feet OP in CBMP, weight on right foot
2. [Open Left Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zui2b2ohA&t=10s) (SQQ SQQ)
	- On the second measure, have leader release right hand in order to separate into open handhold position by the end
	- Ends with leader facing DW, feet OP in CBMP, weight on right foot 
3. Grapevines in open hand hold (QQQQ QQQQ)
	- Ends exactly the same way previous figure ended
4. Twinkle Connection (SQQ) 
	- Leader, release left hand on last step
	- Ends in PP facing DW of new short side 

##### Short Side
5. Flip Flops (SQQ x 4)
	- Over the course of four measures, turns 90 degrees left. So you start in PP facing DW of the short side, and end in open flip flop position (leader on left) facing DW of new long side

##### Long Side
6. Connecting Figure (SQQ)
   - I'm not sure what the actual name of this thing is.
   - Sarah called it the "step feather" at practice because in a sense it's the mirror of a feather step. 
   - On reflection, I'd be inclined to call it the "Unflop" because it takes you out of flip flops and into closed
   - Leader -> 
	   - Take three smallish steps directly forward (DW) (right-left-right)
	   - With your right arm/upper body connection, toss your partner from their position on your right side into closed frame in front of you, catching their right hand with your left
	   - Your body will go from turned right, towards follower, to square forward
   - Follower ->
	   - Step with your left foot and turn left into closed position with your partner
	   - Footwork is identical to what you're doing on the second measure of the Open Reverse Turn
   - Ends in closed position, feet outside partner, facing DW 
7. Twinkle Connection (SQQ)
	- Ends in PP facing DC 
8. Weave from Promenade [FT S4] (SQQ QQQQ)
	- Ends with leader facing DW, feet OP in CBMP  
9. Twinkle Connection (SQQ)
	- Leader, release left hand on last step
	- Ends in PP facing DW of new short side

##### Short Side
10. Flip flops (SQQ x 4)
	- Over the course of four measures, turns 90 degrees left. So you start in PP facing DW of the short side, and end in open flip flop position (leader on left) facing DW of new long side

##### Long Side
11. Unflop (SQQ) (same connecting figure as the start of previous long side)
12. [Hover Telemark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTa_-wD5-eE) (12-4, *NOT* SQQ)
	- Ends with leader facing DC, as if you just took the prep step for the first Feather Step 
--> Repeat from the beginning Feather Step

### Additions

Currently, both short sides are identical. When you're ready to spice things up a bit, you can replace the _first_ short side with the following. 

The preceding figure is the Twinkle Connection at the end of the first long side, and the following figure is the Weave from Promenade on the second long side.

##### Short Side
1. Alt UA Combo [WALTZ S15] (SQQ SQ&Q)
	- This is a waltz video, but it works for Foxtrot if you replace each 1-2-3 with a S-Q-Q (or SQ&Q for the [Underarm Turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zui2b2ohA&t=129s))
	- The video for this figure includes the preceding Twinkle Connection
	- The video ends with only a one hand connection, you'll want to be holding both hands instead
2. Check and Develope [WALTZ S5] (SS)
	- The video actually demonstrates the following two figures as part of the combo
3. Hover Corte (SQQ)
   - ALT: Extend this into a two measure [Hover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zui2b2ohA&t=313s)
4. Open Impetus (SQQ)
	- Where the video ends this combo in PP facing DC, you want to underturn it so it ends PP facing DC of the _new_ LOD
