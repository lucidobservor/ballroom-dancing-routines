_For those just starting silver smooth_
### Legend
- By default, each figure is assumed to take 1 measure of music. Where this isn't the case, it will be noted in parentheses.
- By default, every measure will have both leader and follower taking steps on (1-2-3). Where this isn't the case, the timings will be noted in bullet points below.

### Routine

Your base routine will be the Standard Viennese Waltz routine. That is, do Reverse Turns on the long sides and Natural Turns around the short sides, with Close Changes in between.

To make this a Smooth routine, replace one of your long sides with the following one.

##### Long Side
- Assume you have just come around the short side using Natural Turns. The leader has just done the forward half of the Natural Turn, and is now backing DC of the new long side

1. Close change
	- Rotates 90 degrees right, so leader ends backing DW 
2. Back half of the Reverse Turn
	- Leader ends facing DW, frame opens a bit 
3. Underarm Turn Left
	- Follower will step directly towards center, while turning left (3 step turn)
	- Leader will take a single small step (left) in order to lead the follower's movement without moving much themself
	- Ends in open one hand hold, leader facing and follower backing somewhere between DC and Center
4. Step hover into Butterfly position
	- Follower takes single step on 1 towards center with left foot
	- Leader takes single step on 1 towards wall with right foot
	- Ending position is butterfly position facing LOD; this is the starting position for [VW S8 - Adv Hand to Hand]
5. Butterflies (3 measures, in->out->in)
6. Spot turn
7. Free spin the follower to the right (2 measures)
	- Both leader and follower take 4 steps over the two measures, timing is (1-34-6)
	- Leader is basically stepping directly LOD while facing left
	- Follower is doing a four step turn to the right
	- End by taking open two hand hold on count 6, leader facing and follower backing DC
8. Check and Develope
9. Turn to closed and prep (2 measures) 
	- Leader takes one step back on 1, rises in place while turning follower to closed, then takes a prep step on 6
	- Follower takes baby steps to turn around (left) in place to get into closed, then takes a prep step
-> Proceed into Natural Turns around the short side
