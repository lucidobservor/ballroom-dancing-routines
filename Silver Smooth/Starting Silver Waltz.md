_For those just starting silver smooth_

### Legend
- By default, each figure is assumed to take 1 measure of music. Where this isn't the case, it will be noted in parentheses.
- By default, every measure will have both leader and follower taking steps on (1-2-3). Where this isn't the case, the timings will generally be noted in bullet points below.
- Brackets indicate the video ID for the figure in the [Smooth Tutorial Videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/110kbnV_6VQ6RcOZMEzSdXmG-WJdYvz78?fbclid=IwAR0Pmk-Q_KS2I6-_s5oCFf8LB9XVcN54SD1wHGvT6hpwOuxw5ZOs17tigpk)
