### Routine

Begin just a little ways down a long side, with leader facing DC.
Before starting, sway and prep step with the left foot on count 4.
Expect one competition round to involve running through this routine twice through.

##### Long Side
1. [Feather Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EbBv9b7N8) (SQQ)
	- Ends with leader facing DC, feet OP in CBMP, weight on right foot
2. [Open Left Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zui2b2ohA&t=10s) (SQQ SQQ)
	- On the second measure, have leader release right hand in order to separate into open handhold position by the end
	- Ends with leader facing DW, feet OP in CBMP, weight on right foot 
3. Grapevines in open hand hold (QQQQ QQQQ)
	- Ends exactly the same way previous figure ended
4. Twinkle Connection (SQQ) 
	- Ends in PP facing DW of new short side 

##### Short Side
5. Alt UA Combo [WALTZ S15] (SQQ SQ&Q)
	- This is a waltz video, but it works for Foxtrot if you replace each 1-2-3 with a S-Q-Q (or SQ&Q for the [Underarm Turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zui2b2ohA&t=129s))
	- The video for this figure includes the preceding Twinkle Connection
	- The video ends with only a one hand connection, you'll want to be holding both hands instead
6. Check and Develope [WALTZ S5] (SS)
	- Check in the direction of DC 
7. Hover Corte (SQQ)
   - Ends backing LOD
8. Open Right Box - backwards half first (SQQ SQQ)

	- Ends in PP facing DC 
10. Weave from Promenade [FT S4] (SQQ QQQQ)
	- Ends with leader facing DW, feet OP in CBMP  
11. [Hover Telemark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTa_-wD5-eE) (12-4, *NOT* SQQ)
	- Ends with leader facing DC, as if you just took the prep step for the first Feather Step 
12. Feather step (SQQ) 
13. [Open Left Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zui2b2ohA&t=10s) (SQQ SQQ)
	- Ends with leader facing DW, feet OP in CBMP, weight on right foot

	- Ends in PP facing DW of new short side 
##### Short Side
15. Flip flops (SQQ x 4)
	- Over the course of four measures, turns 90 degrees left. So you start in PP facing DW of the short side, and end in open flip flop position (leader on left) facing DW of new long side

##### Long Side
16. Unflop (SQQ)
    - Leader takes three smallish steps while tossing follower from flip flop into closed
    - Follower footwork is equivalent to a feather finish
    - Ends in closed, feet OP, facing DW
17. [Hover Telemark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTa_-wD5-eE) (12-4, *NOT* SQQ)
